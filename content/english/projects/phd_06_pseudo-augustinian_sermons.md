When it comes to Latin patristic preaching, Saint Augustine is the canon. His ca. 750 sermons
were transmitted as sermon collections in thousands of medieval manuscripts. In the manuscripts
authenticated Augustinian sermons travel with large numbers of sermons wrongly attributed to Augustine,
ca. 150 of which have been classified as anonymous homilies that stem from Late Antiquity or even North
Africa. This
project will recover, describe and analyse the sermons of forgotten late-antique preachers, preserved
through association with Augustine, to contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of inclusion in and exclusion from the canon.
