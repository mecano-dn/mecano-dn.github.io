In modern academia, famous authors, thinkers and philosophers from the ancient world
continue to shape scholarly discourses. However, precisely which canonical references we find in specific
disciplines, and how often they are referred to, is yet to be investigated. The specific objectives of this PhD
project are therefore to build a large, multi-disciplinary corpus of scientific journals from JSTOR. Next
we will reuse existing computational workflows from the Trismegistos project (TM) to detect ancient
canonic references in this corpus. The main analytical objective will be to analyse the extracted
references in a scientometric way, allowing us to investigate which of the canonic thinkers are quoted the
most in different disciplines and whether there are any diachronic trends to be found. Furthermore, we are
interested in co-citation networks, which will help us to understand which canonic authors are frequently
mentioned together and may be even forming canonic clusters. In addition to these more traditional
scientometric approaches, a core methodological objective is to add a distant reading perspective to the
analyses, which allows us to put the canonical references in context and better understand their usage.
With this project we develop a novel approach called ‘contextual scientometrics’.
