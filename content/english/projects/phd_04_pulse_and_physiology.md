Part of the medical canon taught in late antiquity and the middle ages were the Galenic pulse works, which shaped medical theory and practice throughout history. Galenâ€™s own works were greatly
informed by the lost canon of Hellenistic pulse treatises and theories, with which Galen engages
throughout his works and which he cites and quotes profusely. These fragments, together with fragments
in other ancient authors such as Rufus of Ephesus, allow us to uncover and reconstruct the complex and
diverse Hellenistic pulse theories.
