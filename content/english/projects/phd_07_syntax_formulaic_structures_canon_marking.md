Galen’s vast Greek corpus of medical treatises, many also translated into Arabic, offers
perfect territory for exploring language structures in the canonical writer’s toolbox. How original or
common were they? Can the impacts of such canon markers be traced in non-Galenic attestations of
contemporary and other germane language material? Galen’s works spread widely already during his time;
there is also contemporary language material in the form of documentary and (semi)literary papyri of
similar text types (prescriptive passages in recipes and instructions in medical and magical papyri;
stipulations in legal documents; dialogic, narrative, polemical or politeness mechanisms in private letters
and petitions).
