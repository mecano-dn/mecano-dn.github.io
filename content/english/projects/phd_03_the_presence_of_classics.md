The aim of this PhD project is to study the reuse of Latin scientific and technical texts in
(Early) Modern England. The Helsinki Computational History Group has used
automated methods to detect all the instances of text reuse in the largest collections of printed data for
British books (1470â€“1800, > 250.000 works) available in machine-readable form: Eighteenth Century
Collections Online (ECCO) and Early English Books Online (EEBO-tcp phase II). The result is a massive
dataset of linked text-reuse fragments, which are qualified, clustered and compared. Based on this dataset,
the project will focus on the text reuse of a selected group of Latin scientific authors such as Lucretius,
Pliny the Elder, and Vitruvius, and their reception and reuse in Early Modern works.
