It is widely assumed that, at least from Iamblichus (mid 3rd–mid 4th century AD) onwards, in the
Platonic schools of late antiquity philosophical education was organised around a canon of philosophical
texts with works by Aristotle and Plato at the core. It is unclear what role this canon played in actual school
practice and what limits it imposed on the circulation and knowledge of non-canonized Platonic and
Aristotelian works. This project’s goal is to complement the ancient Platonists’ self-understanding of their
philosophical canon with data generated by the study of citations and quotations of Plato and Aristotle in
the Greek commentaries on Aristotle (most of which were written by Platonists).
The project will combine the statistics of the texts and passages quoted in the largest philosophical corpus extant from
antiquity (Commentaria in Aristotelem graeca or CAG) with a qualitative and conceptual analysis of
selected passages.
