In the mid-13th century, just after Aristotle’s works on natural philosophy were translated, various conceptions of matter were at play. The ancient commentaries of these works negotiated the epistemic authority of two canonical authors, Plato and Aristotle, in their mutual relation and in relation
to interpreters from various philosophical traditions. Medieval views on matter were subject to shifts in the canon, with new authorities being added (the Arabic commentators; scholastic
commentators), and shifts in the canonical value of the different authorities (a stronger position of Aristotle
to the detriment of Plato). Further canonical shifts are linked to the incorporation of information from
source texts in other genres (manuals, compendia, doxography, polemical treatises) into the commentary
genre. Although there is a growing literature on medieval theories of matter, there is a need to analyse the
presence of ancient sources and their use by late medieval thinkers.
