I hold a research master’s degree in philosophy from Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne and I additionally studied political science and finance at Sciences Po and HEC Paris. Before joining Radboud Universiteit as a PhD candidate in September 2024, I worked in knowledge valorisation roles for an independent publisher and a think tank. My research project focuses on the reception of Graeco-Roman antiquity in 20th-century public discourse.
