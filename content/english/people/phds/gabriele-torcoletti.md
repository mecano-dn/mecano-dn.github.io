I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Classics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. My research focuses on Hellenistic medicine, particularly the development of pulse science and its clinical applications. By analysing ancient fragments preserved in later authors, I seek to reconstruct the physiological and pathological theories of key Hellenistic physicians. I earned both BA and MA in Classical Philology from the University of Macerata; during my MA studies, I spent two summer semesters (2023 and 2024) as a visiting student at the University of Vienna. Beyond my specific research, I have a strong interest in the interplay between ancient medical theories and their broader cultural and intellectual contexts, as well as in the relationships between different fields of knowledge in the Hellenistic period. I am particularly focused on how medicine, literature, and philosophy interrelated and influenced one another.
