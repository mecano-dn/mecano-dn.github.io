I have a background in medieval manuscript culture in Latin and both Old and Middle English, textual editing, and philosophy. My master's thesis at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, included producing an edition of Ælfric of Eynsham's 10th-century Grammar, the first translation of a Latin grammar into any European vernacular, composed in Latin and Old English. Since completing my master's program I have been a Research Fellow of the Canterbury Tales Project and a copy editor for the Journal of the Northern Renaissance. My MECANO project involves investigating the processes of canonization and canon formation within the fluid corpus of anonymous and pseudonymous late antique and medieval sermons. I am especially interested in exploring the ways in which scholarship may construct post hoc canons which might not accurately reflect the historical reception of the works in question.
