I am a PhD candidate in Ancient Greek Literature and History at Leipzig University in cotutelle with KU Leuven. My research investigates the citations of other authors, specifically historiographers, in Polybius' Histories. In particular, I focus on Polybius' bibliographical practice and citation language. This project also involves the use of digital tools to retrieve relevant linguistic data on the citations (e.g., names of the cited authors, titles or descriptions of cited works, verbs introducing citations). I completed both BA and MA degrees at the University of Pisa and the Scuola Normale Superiore, where I also studied Archaic Lyric Poetry, with a special focus on Pindar and Greek metre.
