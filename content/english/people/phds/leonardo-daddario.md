I am a PhD candidate in Ancient Greek Literature and 
History at Leipzig Univeristy. My research investigates the reception of fragmentary ancient Greek historians in Polybius. Specifically, I focuses on the language that Polybius employs when quoting other historiographers. I 
compelted both BA and MA degrees at the University of Pisa and the 
Scuola Normale Superiore, where I also studied Archaich Lyric Poetry, 
with a special focus on Pindar and Greek metre.
