I am a Doctoral Researcher in Digital Humanities at the Faculty of Arts at the University of Helsinki. I have a background in Ancient History and I'm currently a member of the MSCA doctoral network MECANO and the Helsinki Computational History Group. My research focus is on the presence of the classics in early modern British book history, especially regarding the reception and reuse of ancient texts and their publication patterns in the printing industry.
