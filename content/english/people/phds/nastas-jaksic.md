I hold a BA in Philosophy and Classics and an MA in Classics from the University of Belgrade, as well as an MA in Ancient Philosophy from LMU Munich. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD within the framework of the MECANO project, in a cotutelle arrangement between Helsinki University and KU Leuven, focusing on ancient sources in late medieval commentaries on Aristotle's Physics and Metaphysics. Additionally, I am passionate about ancient philosophy in general, Latin and Ancient Greek.
