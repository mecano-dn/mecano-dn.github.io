I come from Alicante, in Spain. After obtaining my bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid, I 
pursued a master's degree in Statistics and Data Science, with the idea of recycling my coding expertise to explore NLP. My research interests are diverse, including library studies and scientometrics, (computational) literary studies, and AI applications to the humanities.
