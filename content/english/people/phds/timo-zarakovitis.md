I am Timo Zarakovitis, a new PhD at KU Leuven in the MECANO project. I have started interdisciplinary research on the canonicity of Plato’s and Aristotle’s philosophy by analysing quotation with DH approaches. It is the aim of this research to build a database of these authors being quoted in the Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca and to speak about the history of philosophy and canonization on the basis of this corpus, which spans from the second century CE until the Byzantine period.
